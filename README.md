# Type Racer

Type Racer is a fun and interactive game that helps improve your typing speed. This project is built using a modern tech stack including React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and WebSocket.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the server-side code written in Node.js and Express. It uses WebSocket for real-time communication between the server and clients.
- `frontend/`: Contains the client-side code written in React and TypeScript. It uses Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.
- `shared/`: Contains the types that are shared between the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typeracer.git

2. Install Dependencies

```sh

cd backend
npm install

# In the frontend directory
cd ../frontend
npm install # In the backend directory

# In a new terminal, in the frontend directory
npm run dev
```

3. Start development servers

```sh
